假如可以选择生活，我宁愿简简单单。一个茶杯，一桩茅屋 ，一亩良田，

Welcome to find me on [QzoneWaynic](http://user.qzone.qq.com/1164275839), the Qzone for official Me Media . It's designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.

There are currently three themes built on Poole:

* [Weibo](http://weibo.com/5344367757/profile?rightmod=1&wvr=6&mod=personinfo)
* [PersonalQzone](http://user.qzone.qq.com/806138756), 
* [Facebook](http://enfield.getpoole.com)
* [简书](http://)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}).

### What's included

Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it like this one, includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404]({{ site.baseurl }}/404.html), [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/atom.xml), posts, and [example page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll's built-in support for Rouge

Additional features are available in individual themes.

### Browser support

Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

These themes are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
